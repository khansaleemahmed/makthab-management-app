[02-cloud-deployment-aws.md](./02-cloud-deployment-aws.md) (ECS Fargate + RDS + S3),
[03-security.md](./03-security.md) (IAM/KMS/Secrets Manager baseline).
**See also:** [00-overview-and-prioritization.md](./00-overview-and-prioritization.md) for the
overall attack order and phase framework this document follows.

## 0. Status update — 2026-09-04

Revisited with the business owner after this document was originally drafted.
Recorded here rather than rewritten in place, so the reasoning trail stays
intact.

**Tenancy model: confirmed.** Model A (shared schema, `tenantId` column, with
Postgres RLS as a second enforced layer — §2/§3.2) is the chosen approach.
No open decision remains on §2's decision matrix.

**Phases 1-3 status: substantially already shipped**, ahead of where this
document assumed when written. Verified against the current codebase, not
re-derived from this doc's original assumptions:
- **Phase 1 (multi-database abstraction):** done. `server/prisma/schema.prisma`
  is the canonical Postgres schema; `server/prisma/sqlite/schema.prisma` is
  generated from it. `DATABASE_PROVIDER=sqlite|postgresql` selects the active
  generated client at runtime (`server/src/db/client.ts`), and all route/service
  code already goes through the repository layer in `server/src/db/index.ts` —
  exactly the DAO boundary this phase called for, and exactly what the tenancy
  work in §3.2's Prisma Client Extension needs to hook into (one place, not
  ~40 call-sites).
- **Phase 2 (AWS deployment):** partially done. `infra/terraform/envs/staging`
  exists with an RDS-shaped variable set (`db_instance_class`, `db_name`,
  `db_username`, `db_password`, `jwt_secret`). Production env and the full
  CloudFront/ALB/ECS topology from this doc's §4 diagram were not re-verified
  in this pass — worth confirming before Phase 4c's real second-tenant
  provisioning, since that step assumes the wildcard-subdomain routing this
  doc's §6 step 7 describes.
- **Phase 3 (security hardening):** done. `RefreshSession` (rotating refresh
  JWTs), login rate-limiting + lockout, `AuditLog` (hash-chained, append-only),
  and DB-backed `Role`/`RolePermissionAudit` are all live per
  `docs/architecture/BUILD_CONTRACT.md`'s changelog (2026-08-04 entries). This
  satisfies §3's "security before multi-tenancy" sequencing.

**Net effect:** the prerequisites this document's §3 attack-order argument
required are in place. Phase 4 (this document) is next in sequence, gated
only on the demand-confirmation question in the overview's §6.1 (unchanged —
this pass did not re-litigate that business question).

**Model inventory is stale — see the correction in §5.** Contribution,
MonthlyProgress, and the full auth/audit model set (Role, RolePermissionAudit,
AuditLog, RefreshSession, OtpChallenge, PasswordResetToken,
UserApprovalAudit, AdminNotification) were added to the schema after this
document's original §5 list was written and are folded in below.

**Product naming: confirmed.** The product is being renamed from "Makthab"
to **Maktab Cloud** — see §11 for the rationale and the rename checklist
(not executed in this pass; documented as a scoped follow-up).

---

## 1. Executive summary

This is the highest-risk, most speculative phase in the whole plan, and it
should be read that way. The overview doc's §0 already flags that the entire
brief is a pivot from "software for one Madrasa" to "SaaS sold to many
Masajid" — nowhere is that more true than here. Everything in this document
is buildable, but **do not start it until §6.1 of the overview
(confirmed multi-Masjid demand) is actually true.** If it isn't, Phases 1-3
plus the UI track already ship a materially better single-tenant product;
building tenancy on spec ahead of a second customer is the single biggest
line item in the global risk register (overview §8, "Multi-tenancy is built
but never sold").

With that caveat stated once: if the business case is confirmed, this phase
converts Makthab from a hard-coded single organization into a system that
can host N independent Masajid, each with isolated data, independent
branding, independent staff/roles, and independent billing, while sharing
one application deployment and one database cluster for operational
efficiency.

**Correction to the overview doc's baseline note:** the overview
characterizes the current `OrgProfile` model as "multi-row branding." Having
read `server/prisma/schema.prisma` directly, that's not quite right — it's a
**single-row-by-convention** table (`id: 1`), and its own schema comment
already names the seam: *"the seam for future multi-tenancy — add a
`tenantId` FK here... and scope the lookup by `req.tenantId` instead of 'the
one row'."* That comment is effectively a note-to-self from the team that
built it, and this document is the design that fulfills it. Similarly, the
`Role` model (commit `1551`) is DB-backed with JSON permission sets and
`isSystem` seed rows (Admin/Accountant/Teacher) — a good foundation, but
`Role.name` is currently globally unique, which needs to change for tenancy
(§3.3).

---

## 2. Tenancy model decision matrix

Three standard models, scored against this app's actual shape: ~9-10
Prisma models, financial + minor (student) data, an existing single-tenant
schema to migrate from, and a plausible customer count in the tens-to-low-
hundreds of Masajid (not thousands) even at optimistic growth.

| Model | Isolation strength | Migration cost from current schema | Operational complexity | Per-tenant infra cost | Blast radius of a bug |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Shared DB, shared schema** (`tenantId` column on every table) | Medium — enforced entirely by query correctness unless paired with RLS | **Low** — add a column, backfill, index. No schema-per-tenant tooling needed. | **Low** — one schema to migrate, one connection pool, standard Prisma workflow | **Lowest** — tenants share compute and DB instance | High if unmitigated (one bad `WHERE` clause = cross-tenant leak); mitigated to Low with RLS (see §3.2) |
| **B. Shared DB, separate schema per tenant** (Postgres `CREATE SCHEMA tenant_x`) | High — Postgres enforces schema boundaries natively | High — Prisma has no native "one schema per tenant, N tenants, dynamically" story; requires either N generated Prisma Client instances or raw SQL schema-switching, plus a migration runner that applies every migration to every tenant schema | High — provisioning = running the full migration set per new tenant; connection pooling gets awkward (pool per schema, or `search_path` juggling per request) | Medium — still one DB instance, but per-schema migration/backup tooling overhead scales with tenant count | Medium — a schema-switching bug can still leak across schemas if `search_path` is set wrong |
| **C. Separate database per tenant** | Highest — full engine-level isolation, can even live on different RDS instances | Highest — no code change to the schema itself, but application needs a tenant→connection-string router, and "list all tenants" cross-cutting admin queries become fan-out queries across N databases | Highest — N databases to patch, back up, monitor, and pay for individually; migrations must be run N times | Highest — either N small RDS instances (expensive at idle) or N databases on shared instances (loses some isolation benefit anyway) | Lowest, but the operational surface (N things to get right) creates its own risk |

### Recommendation: start with **Model A (shared schema) + Postgres Row-Level
Security as a second, DB-enforced layer**, with a documented escape hatch to
Model C for a single outlier tenant later.

Rationale:
- Model A has by far the lowest migration cost from the current schema — it
  is additive (`tenantId` columns + indexes), not a schema topology change.
  Given this app's realistic tenant count (tens, not thousands), Model B's
  extra operational complexity buys isolation the app doesn't clearly need,
  while Model C's per-tenant cost doesn't make sense until a tenant is large
  enough or sensitive enough to justify dedicated infrastructure (e.g. a
  future enterprise customer with a data-residency requirement).
- The one real weakness of Model A — "isolation is only as good as every
  query's `WHERE tenantId = ?`" — is exactly what Postgres RLS is for: a
  policy enforced by the database engine itself, so a missed filter in
  application code fails closed instead of leaking data. This is standard
  "defense in depth," not an either/or with careful application code — do
  both (§3.2).
- **Hybrid escape hatch:** because the `tenantId`-column design is identical
  regardless of which physical database a row lives in, a specific tenant
  can be migrated later to its own RDS instance (Model C) without changing
  application code — only the connection-routing layer changes for that one
  tenant. Document this now so it's a known lever, not a redesign, if a
  future customer needs it (e.g. a large tenant hitting noisy-neighbor
  limits, or a contractual isolation requirement).

---

## 3. Architecture & design decisions

### 3.1 Tenant identification: subdomain-per-tenant

Use `{tenant-slug}.makthab.app` (e.g. `masjid-umar.makthab.app`), resolved
at the edge (CloudFront/ALB → API middleware extracts the subdomain and
resolves it to a `tenantId` via a small, heavily-cached `Tenant` lookup
table).

Trade-off considered and rejected: a path prefix (`makthab.app/masjid-umar/`)
or a header-based scheme. Subdomain wins here because (a) it lets each
tenant's white-labeled UI (Phase 5's theming) feel like *their* installation
rather than a shared multi-tenant app with a URL-embedded slug, which
matters for a product being sold to religious institutions who value having
"their own" system, and (b) it keeps API route paths identical to today's
(`/api/v1/students`, etc.) — no path-prefix stripping logic threaded through
every route, which reduces the chance of a routing bug becoming a tenant
isolation bug.

### 3.2 Data isolation: `tenantId` column + Prisma Client Extension + Postgres RLS

Two independent, stacked layers — neither alone is sufficient:

**Layer 1 — application-enforced, via Prisma Client Extensions.** Prisma
does not have first-class multi-tenancy middleware (the older
`$use()` middleware API is deprecated in favor of Client Extensions as of
Prisma 5, which is what this app already runs). Build a request-scoped
Prisma Client Extension that:
- Auto-injects `tenantId: ctx.tenantId` into every `where` clause on
  tenant-scoped models, for `find*`, `update*`, `delete*`, `count`, `aggregate`.
- Auto-injects `tenantId: ctx.tenantId` into every `create`/`createMany`
  payload.
- Throws (fails closed) if a query somehow reaches the DB layer without a
  resolved `tenantId` in request context.

This is safer than hand-writing `where: { tenantId, ... }` on ~40+ query
call-sites across `server/src/routes/*`, which is exactly the kind of
repetitive, easy-to-forget pattern that produces the "Cross-tenant data
leak" entry in the overview's global risk register.

**Layer 2 — database-enforced, via Postgres RLS.** Independent of whether
the application layer gets it right, enable RLS on every tenant-scoped
table and set a session variable (`SET app.current_tenant_id = $1`) at the
top of each request/transaction. Example policy:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "Student" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON "Student"
  USING ("tenantId" = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::int)
  WITH CHECK ("tenantId" = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::int);
```

Applied identically (mechanically, via a migration-generation script — not
hand-written per table) to `Student`, `FeePayment`, `Attendance`, `Expense`,
`Staff`, `SalaryPayment`, `SalaryPayment`, `Class`, `Category`,
`AcademicYear`, `ExpenseCategory`, `FeeStructure`, `OrgProfile`, `User`.
This means even a raw SQL query, an admin script, or a future engineer who
bypasses the Prisma extension cannot cross tenant boundaries — the failure
mode becomes "query returns zero rows" rather than "query returns another
tenant's financial records."

**Connection pooling implication:** setting a per-request session variable
means the DB connection carrying that session cannot be silently reused for
a different tenant's request without resetting it first — this affects how
RDS Proxy / pgbouncer pooling is configured. Use **transaction-mode
pooling** (reset session state between transactions, which RDS Proxy and
pgbouncer both support) rather than a naive "session pooling" mode, and set
`app.current_tenant_id` inside the same transaction as the query, not as a
separate connection-level `SET`.

### 3.3 Roles become tenant-scoped

Today, `Role.name` is globally `@unique` (Admin/Accountant/Teacher seeded
as `isSystem` rows, per schema comment on `Role`). Two changes:
- Add `tenantId` to `Role`, change the uniqueness constraint to
  `@@unique([tenantId, name])`.
- Keep the three system roles as a **template seeded per tenant at
  provisioning time** (§6), not shared global rows — this lets a future
  tenant customize a role's permission set without affecting others, while
  still starting every tenant with the same Admin/Accountant/Teacher
  baseline the app already ships.
- `User.role` continues to store the role name; resolution to a permission
  set becomes `(tenantId, roleName) → permissions` instead of just
  `roleName → permissions`.

### 3.4 JWT claims carry tenant context

Add `tenantId` (and `tenantSlug`, to avoid a lookup on every request) to the
JWT payload at login. `requireAuth` middleware sets `req.tenantId` from the
verified token; this is the value both the Prisma Client Extension (§3.2
Layer 1) and the RLS session variable (§3.2 Layer 2) consume. Reject any
token whose `tenantId` doesn't match the resolved subdomain's tenant (§3.1)
— this specifically prevents a stolen/replayed token for Tenant A being
used against Tenant B's subdomain.

### 3.5 `OrgProfile` becomes the tenant's branding row

Per the schema comment already in the codebase, `OrgProfile` gains
`tenantId` and stops being a singleton-by-convention — one row per tenant,
looked up by `req.tenantId` instead of "the row with `id: 1`." This is the
integration point with Phase 5's white-label theming (logo, header image,
institution name/address already exist on this model; colors/theme tokens
would be new fields added in Phase 5).

## 5. Data partitioning strategy

- **Column placement:** `tenantId Int` (FK to a new `Tenant` model) added to
  every model currently listed in `schema.prisma` except pure reference
  data that's genuinely global across the whole product (there isn't much —
  even `ExpenseCategory` and `Category` need to become tenant-scoped, since
  different Masajid will want different category lists; only the
  `PERMISSION_CATALOG` constant in `@makthab/shared` stays global, since
  it's code, not data).

  **Corrected full inventory (2026-09-04 — the original list below predated
  several models):**

  | Model | tenantId? | Notes |
  |---|---|---|
  | `Student`, `FeePayment`, `Attendance`, `Expense`, `Contribution`, `MonthlyProgress`, `SalaryPayment`, `Staff`, `Class`, `Category`, `AcademicYear`, `ExpenseCategory`, `FeeStructure` | Yes | Core domain tables — as originally scoped, plus `Contribution` and `MonthlyProgress` (added 2026-08-09/10, after this doc's first draft). Each also gets its own `tenantId` even where reachable via a FK (e.g. `MonthlyProgress.studentId`), so RLS (§3.2 Layer 2) can enforce the boundary on that table directly without a join. |
  | `OrgProfile` | Yes | Becomes one-or-more rows *per tenant* (the app already supports multi-row letterhead switching via `isActive` — memory: multi-row OrgProfile branding, 2026-07-25). The `isActive` uniqueness ("only one active row") must become tenant-scoped, not global. |
  | `Role`, `RolePermissionAudit` | Yes | Per §3.3. `RolePermissionAudit` didn't exist in the original draft (added with Phase 3 security hardening, 2026-08-04); needs `tenantId` for the same RLS reasons as its parent `Role`. |
  | `User` | Yes | As originally scoped. |
  | `RefreshSession`, `OtpChallenge`, `PasswordResetToken`, `UserApprovalAudit`, `AdminNotification` | Yes | Auth/session/audit models added with Phase 3 security hardening (2026-08-04), not present when this doc was first drafted. All reachable via `userId`, but each still gets its own `tenantId` for the same direct-RLS-enforcement reason as above — a leaked refresh session or OTP is as sensitive as a leaked financial row. |
  | `AuditLog` | Yes | The security audit trail itself must be tenant-scoped — an unscoped `AuditLog` would let Tenant A's admin read Tenant B's login/mutation history via `/admin/audit-logs`. Not in the original draft. |
  | *(new)* `Tenant` | — (is the tenant) | See below. |

- **New `Tenant` model:** `id`, `slug` (unique, used for subdomain
  resolution), `name`, `status` (active/suspended/offboarding), `createdAt`,
  plan/billing fields as needed later.
- **Indexing:** every tenant-scoped table gets `tenantId` as the **leading
  column** of its primary lookup indexes, e.g. `@@index([tenantId, status])`
  on `Student` (currently just `@@index([status])`), `@@index([tenantId,
  feeYear, feeMonth])` on `FeePayment`. This matches the query pattern
  every request will actually use (always filtered by tenant first) and
  keeps index scans cheap as tenant count grows — without this, a global
  index on `status` alone gets progressively less selective as more
  tenants' data accumulates in the same table.
- **Unique constraints need `tenantId` prefixed in:** `Student.admissionNo`,
  `FeePayment.receiptNo`, `Contribution.receiptNo`, `Expense.voucherNo`,
  `Class.name`, `Category.name`, `AcademicYear.name`, `ExpenseCategory.name`,
  `Role.name` (§3.3), `User.username`/`User.email`/`User.phone`,
  `MonthlyProgress`'s `@@unique([studentId, month, year])`,
  `Attendance`'s `@@unique([studentId, date])`,
  `SalaryPayment`'s `@@unique([staffId, salaryMonth, salaryYear])`,
  `FeeStructure`'s `@@unique([classId, categoryId, academicYearId, feeType])`
  — every one of these is currently globally unique (or scoped only by an
  already-tenant-scoped FK) and must become `@@unique([tenantId, ...])`,
  otherwise Tenant B can't reuse "LKG" as a class name or "admin" as a
  username just because Tenant A already has one. This is the single
  largest mechanical change in the migration (§8). The `Contribution`/
  `MonthlyProgress`/`Attendance`/`SalaryPayment`/`FeeStructure` entries are
  additions to the original list — confirmed against the current schema
  during the 2026-09-04 pass.
- **RLS policy design:** see §3.2 for the canonical policy shape; generate
  one per tenant-scoped table via a small script rather than hand-writing
  ~13 nearly-identical policies (reduces the chance of one table being
  missed — a missed RLS policy is silently no worse than today, but it's a
  gap worth catching with a CI check, see §10).
- **Connection pooling:** RDS Proxy in transaction-mode pooling (§3.2),
  sized for the concurrency profile described in
  [02-cloud-deployment-aws.md](./02-cloud-deployment-aws.md) — this doc
  doesn't re-derive those numbers, just notes that pool sizing needs
  revisiting once real tenant-count/concurrency assumptions exist, since
  "N tenants sharing a pool" behaves differently under load than the
  single-tenant baseline that doc sizes for.

---

## 6. Tenant provisioning / onboarding & offboarding

### Onboarding (target: fully scriptable, manual trigger initially; self-serve UI is Phase 4c, see §8)

1. Create `Tenant` row (slug, name, status = `provisioning`).
2. Seed reference data scoped to the new `tenantId`, following the exact
   pattern the app already uses for its single-tenant seed (academic years,
   classes, expense categories) — reuse that seed script's structure,
   parameterized by `tenantId` instead of hard-coded.
3. Seed the three system `Role` rows (Admin/Accountant/Teacher) with the
   default `PERMISSION_CATALOG`-derived permission sets, scoped to the new
   `tenantId` (§3.3).
4. Create the initial `Staff` + `User` (Admin role) record for the
   customer's first login; deliver credentials out-of-band (not email,
   given no email infra is assumed yet — matches the app's existing
   WhatsApp-first communication pattern).
5. Create an `OrgProfile` row for the tenant (§3.5) — name/address at
   minimum; branding assets added by the customer post-login.
6. Provision the S3 prefix (`s3://makthab-files/{tenantId}/...`) — no
   explicit "creation" needed for an S3 prefix, but apply/verify the IAM
   bucket policy condition scoping access to it (Phase 3's security
   baseline).
7. Register the subdomain (`{slug}.makthab.app`) — either a wildcard
   CloudFront/ALB config (provisioned once, covers all tenants) or a
   per-tenant DNS record, depending on what Phase 2's actual CloudFront
   setup allows; prefer the wildcard approach so onboarding doesn't require
   an infra change per tenant.
8. Flip `Tenant.status` to `active`.

### Offboarding

1. Flip `Tenant.status` to `suspended` immediately (blocks login via the
   tenant-resolution check in §3.1/3.4) if this is an involuntary/non-payment
   offboarding; skip straight to step 2 for a voluntary customer-initiated
   export.
2. **Data export:** generate a full export of the tenant's data — reuse the
   app's existing Excel report infrastructure (ExcelJS is already a
   dependency for reports) rather than building new export tooling; a
   "full data dump" is a natural extension of the existing per-report Excel
   generation, one workbook per entity or one multi-sheet workbook.
3. Deliver the export to the customer (a signed, time-limited S3 URL is
   simplest given files are already in S3 post-Phase-2).
4. **Retention window:** hold the tenant's data (DB rows + S3 objects) for
   a defined period post-offboarding (align this with whatever [03-security.md](./03-security.md)'s
   compliance section lands on for data-retention policy — this doc doesn't
   set that number, since it's a compliance/legal decision, not an
   architecture one — but a reasonable operational default is 30-90 days
   before hard deletion, giving the customer a recovery window).
5. **Hard deletion:** after the retention window, delete the tenant's rows
   (a `tenantId`-scoped cascade delete, or a scripted per-table delete) and
   the S3 prefix. Log the deletion event (who/when/why) for audit purposes.

---

## 7. Scalability patterns

- **Autoscaling:** ECS Fargate service auto-scaling (established in Phase 2)
  with target-tracking policies on CPU utilization and ALB request count
  per target — this doesn't change structurally for multi-tenancy, since
  all tenants share the same Fargate service/task pool in Model A. The
  thing that *does* change is capacity planning: size baseline task count
  and scaling thresholds off aggregate multi-tenant load, not the
  single-tenant baseline Phase 2 was sized for.
- **Caching:** the app's genuinely global-ish reference data (per tenant:
  `Class`, `Category`, `AcademicYear`, `ExpenseCategory`, `Role`
  permission sets, `OrgProfile` branding) changes rarely and is read on
  nearly every request (e.g. every student list render needs class names).
  Cache these per-tenant with a short TTL or explicit invalidation on
  write (an in-process LRU cache is enough at this scale; do not reach for
  ElastiCache/Redis until there's a measured need — matches the overview's
  "don't over-engineer for an app this size" principle). **Financial data
  (`FeePayment`, `SalaryPayment`, `Expense`) and `Student`/`Attendance`
  records are not cached** — they're written frequently and correctness
  matters more than shaving a query.
- **Per-tenant rate limiting:** protect against one noisy or misbehaving
  tenant (buggy integration, scraping, or a runaway report-generation loop)
  degrading service for others. Implement a token-bucket limiter keyed by
  `tenantId` at the Express middleware layer (a small, well-understood
  library-based approach is sufficient here — no need for API-Gateway-level
  throttling given the ALB→Fargate architecture from Phase 2). Set limits
  generously for normal usage (this app's per-tenant traffic is inherently
  low — a school office, not a high-traffic consumer app) and alert (not
  just block) when a tenant approaches its limit, since it's more likely a
  bug than abuse at this product's scale.
- **Observability per tenant:** tag CloudWatch log entries and custom
  metrics with `tenantId` (structured logging, not just free text) so
  per-tenant dashboards and noisy-neighbor detection are queryable without
  re-architecting logging later. This is cheap to add now and expensive to
  retrofit — treat it as part of Phase 4's definition of done, not a
  follow-up.

---

## 8. Migration/implementation plan

Fits the overview's **8-12 week** window for Phase 4, split into four
sub-phases so risk is introduced incrementally rather than in one big-bang
migration:

| Sub-phase | Weeks | Scope | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| **4a — Additive schema change** | 1-3 | Add `tenantId` (nullable) to every model in §5; create `Tenant` model; backfill every existing row with a single `Tenant` record representing the current live Masjid, so the running app doesn't break mid-migration. Add composite indexes. | App still runs exactly as today (single implicit tenant), `tenantId` present but not yet enforced. |
| **4b — Enforcement** | 3-6 | Make `tenantId` `NOT NULL`; ship the Prisma Client Extension (§3.2 L1); enable RLS policies (§3.2 L2) table-by-table with a verification query after each; update all `@unique` constraints (§5) to be tenant-prefixed; add `tenantId`/`tenantSlug` to JWT (§3.4); wire subdomain resolution (§3.1). | The existing single tenant continues working end-to-end through the new tenant-aware path; the cross-tenant isolation test suite (§10) exists and passes trivially (only one tenant exists, but the plumbing is exercised). |
| **4c — Provisioning + a second real tenant** | 6-9 | Build the onboarding script (§6) — CLI/admin-triggered is enough for now, a self-serve UI is a later product decision, not an architecture requirement of this phase; provision a genuine second tenant (even a demo/staging one) end-to-end; run the isolation test suite (§10) against real two-tenant data for the first time. | Two tenants coexist with verified isolation; onboarding runbook is documented and repeatable. |
| **4d — Scale/ops hardening** | 9-12 | Per-tenant rate limiting, autoscaling threshold review, per-tenant observability tagging (§7); offboarding workflow (§6) implemented and dry-run tested. | Phase 4 exit criteria from the overview's §5 table met: isolation tests in CI, rate limits + autoscaling live. |

## 9. Risk assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cross-tenant data leak** (missed `tenantId` filter, RLS policy gap, or subdomain-spoofing) | Low-Med during 4b, should trend to Low after | Critical | Two independent enforcement layers (§3.2); automated isolation test suite in CI (§10) as a hard gate, not just a manual QA pass; code-review checklist item requiring any new table/query to justify its tenant-scoping. |
| **A missed `@@unique` constraint** blocks a second tenant from using a name the first tenant already used (e.g. class "I") | Medium during 4b | Medium (functional bug, not a security leak) | Enumerate every current `@unique`/`@@unique` in `schema.prisma` explicitly (done in §5) and treat each as a checklist item during 4b, not something to catch ad hoc. |
| **RLS session-variable leak across pooled connections** (a connection reused for Tenant B without resetting `app.current_tenant_id`) | Low, but high-severity if it happens | Critical | Transaction-mode pooling (§3.2) specifically to avoid this class of bug; add a regression test that opens two rapid concurrent requests from different tenants and asserts no cross-contamination. |
| **Provisioning script drifts from the real seed requirements** as the schema evolves post-launch (someone adds a new reference-data table and forgets to update onboarding) | Medium over time | Medium | Keep the provisioning script co-located with and derived from the same seed logic the single-tenant app already uses (§6 step 2), rather than a hand-maintained duplicate. |
| **Multi-tenancy ships but isn't sold** | Medium | High (wasted engineering spend) | Already the top entry in the overview's global risk register — the mitigation is sequencing (confirm demand before starting this phase at all), not anything inside this document's technical design. |

## 10. Testing/validation plan

The **cross-tenant isolation test suite is the centerpiece** of validating
this phase — more important than conventional feature test coverage, given
what's at stake (financial + minor data for potentially many independent
customers on shared infrastructure).

**What it tests, concretely:**
- Provision two test tenants (Tenant A, Tenant B) with distinct data:
  students, fee payments, attendance, expenses, staff, salary payments,
  roles, and an `OrgProfile` row each.
- Authenticate as a Tenant A user (Admin role, to rule out permission
  checks masking a tenancy bug).
- For **every** API endpoint the app exposes (walk the full route table —
  students, fees, attendance, expenses, staff, salaries, reports,
  reference/classes/academic-years/expense-categories, dashboard,
  admin/backup, auth), attempt to read, update, and delete Tenant B's
  record IDs using Tenant A's authenticated session.
- **Expected result for every single one: 403 or 404, never 200 and never
  Tenant B's data in the response body.** Any endpoint returning Tenant B
  data, or successfully mutating/deleting it, is a release-blocking failure.
- Additionally test the **list/search endpoints** specifically (not just
  get-by-id) — confirm Tenant A's student list, defaulters report, etc.
  never contains a Tenant B row, since list endpoints are the easiest place
  to miss a filter.
- Test the **JWT/subdomain mismatch** case from §3.4 directly: a valid
  Tenant A token presented against Tenant B's subdomain must be rejected.
- Test the **RLS layer in isolation** from the application layer: run a raw
  SQL query (bypassing Prisma entirely, simulating "what if the app-layer
  filter has a bug") with the RLS session variable set to Tenant A, and
  confirm zero Tenant B rows are returned — this is what proves Layer 2
  (§3.2) is actually load-bearing and not just theoretical defense-in-depth.

**Where it runs:** added to the existing Jest integration suite pattern
(`server/`, run via `DATABASE_URL=... npx jest`, per `CLAUDE.md`), and per
the overview's §7 success metrics, **must run in CI on every PR that
touches a data-access path** (routes, Prisma schema, the Client Extension
itself) — not just before release. Treat a failure here with the same
severity as a broken build, not a flaky test to retry.

**Non-functional validation:** once 4c's second real tenant exists, run the
same load-test approach [02-cloud-deployment-aws.md](./02-cloud-deployment-aws.md)
defines for the single-tenant baseline, but with concurrent traffic from
both tenants simultaneously, to validate the rate-limiting (§7) and
connection-pool-sizing assumptions (§5) under realistic multi-tenant
concurrency rather than assuming they hold.

## 11. Product naming — Makthab → Maktab Cloud

Decided 2026-09-04, alongside confirming the tenancy model in §0/§2. Not
executed in this pass — this section is the scoped checklist for a future
session, kept here because the rename and the multi-tenancy pivot are the
same underlying business decision (single-Masjid tool → product sold to
many).

**Name:** "Maktab Cloud". Two changes from the current name:
- **Spelling correction:** "Makthab" → "Maktab", the standard transliteration
  of مكتب (maktab — school/office), dropping the inserted "h" that doesn't
  correspond to any letter in the Arabic/Urdu source. This is a legibility
  fix as much as a rebrand.
- **"Cloud" suffix:** signals the SaaS/multi-tenant positioning directly (in
  the spirit of established patterns like "Salesforce", "Workday" —
  descriptive, not cute), and reads naturally with the subdomain scheme this
  doc already specifies in §3.1 (`{tenant-slug}.maktab.app` — formerly
  written as `.makthab.app` throughout §3.1/§4/§6/§7; update those
  references when this rename is executed).

**Rename checklist (do this as its own PR, separate from any tenancy code
change, so a broken build is easy to bisect):**
1. `package.json` root `name` (`makthab-app` → `maktab-cloud` or similar) and
   `description`.
2. npm workspace scope `@makthab/shared` → `@maktab/shared` — touches every
   import across `client/`, `server/`, and the package's own `package.json`;
   mechanical but wide (grep-and-replace, then `npm run typecheck` as the
   verification gate).
3. `CLAUDE.md` (both the project name in the header and the "Makthab" prose
   references) and every doc under `docs/` that names the product
   (`docs/architecture/BUILD_CONTRACT.md`'s title/§0, this redesign doc set,
   `docs/migration/MIGRATION.md`).
4. Directory/db-file names that embed the old identity: `data/madrasa.db`
   (fine to keep — "madrasa" is a generic noun, not the brand — but note it
   if the team wants full consistency), Terraform `project` variable default
   (`infra/terraform/envs/staging/variables.tf` line 13-16, currently
   `default = "makthab"` — also feeds `db_name`/`db_username` defaults on
   the same file, so this touches the RDS instance naming, not just labels).
5. Client-visible strings: page titles, the login screen, PDF/receipt
   letterhead defaults (`OrgProfile` seed data — note this is *tenant*
   branding, separate from *product* branding; don't conflate a tenant's
   own Masjid name with the Maktab Cloud product name in the UI chrome).
6. Domain registration and DNS (`maktab.app` or whatever TLD is chosen) —
   an actual external/account-level action, do this deliberately and early
   since §3.1's subdomain-per-tenant design depends on owning the apex
   domain before Phase 4c's provisioning work can point real subdomains at
   it.
7. Any external references already created this session in the repo working
   tree unrelated to this doc (none as of this pass) should be swept for the
   old name too — not found during this review, but worth a final
   `git grep -i makthab` pass right before the rename PR merges, since new
   references accumulate between when this checklist is written and when
   it's executed.
