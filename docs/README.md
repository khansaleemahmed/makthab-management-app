| [`architecture/`](./architecture) | System & React/TS architecture docs, diagrams, and the build contract (single source of truth for the API/data model). |
| [`migration/`](./migration) | How the legacy spreadsheet data was imported — see [MIGRATION.md](./migration/MIGRATION.md) — plus the original migration plan and mapping diagram. |
| [`reference/`](./reference) | Background study of the Maktab operation and developer context notes. |
| [`development/`](./development) | Developer-facing guides, e.g. [TESTING.md](./development/TESTING.md). |
